# Breast-Cancer-Image-Based-Classification

## Implementation
I have uploaded a single.ipynb file containing the complete code with proper comments and subheadings. I used Google Colab for writing and implementing the code.

### CNN Model:
* epochs = 10
* batch size = 32
* class mode for training = binary

Output obtained for the 14 test images (Predicted labels): [[1],[0],[0],[1],[1],[0],[0],[0],[1],[1],[0],[0],[1],[0]]
